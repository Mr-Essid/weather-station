# Weather Station Project

The Weather Station is a project designed to observe temperature, humidity, and pressure in
real-time through the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. In this application, I
will guide you through the creation of a mobile application that retrieves data from the MQTT broker
and displays it in a visually appealing manner.

Special thanks to Mr. Karim Ben Romthan for his support in this project.

### Programming Language

    Android: Kotlin
    Hardware (ESP32): MicroPython

### Cloud

To implement this solution, you need to create a broker that supports the MQTT protocol, such as:

    HiveMQ: The platform used in this project, which offers a free plan.
    Mosquitto: Another platform supporting the MQTT protocol that you can use.
